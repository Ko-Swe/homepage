We have seen an exponential increase in the number of web apps over the last few years, with an app for everything. I was going to make a joke about even having “Uber for dog walking” but it actually exists so I guess the joke is on me. One of the best ways to make yourself stand out from the 43 alternatives to your product is to really nail the user experience.

Regardless of your views about Javascript, it has made apps such as Facebook and Google Docs a pleasure to use. This post assumes Javascript apps are here to stay for quite a while longer, I will write another post about what it will take for a new paradigm to usurp the UI throne.

So if you accept the fact that they are here to stay, then which framework should you choose for your next application? 

```javascript
// Please don’t nitpick what I called a framework here
var frameworks = [‘angular’, ‘backbone’, ‘polymer’, ‘react’, ‘flight’, ‘spine’, ‘ember’, ‘knockout’, ‘agility’, ‘canjs’, ‘maria’, ‘extjs’, ‘sammyjs’, ‘stapesjs’, ‘kendo’]; // etc
```

I would like to posit a more important question especially to those front end inclined.
