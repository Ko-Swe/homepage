<p>I'm a full stack web developer who generally works remotely and also is sometimes a technical lead. At the moment I'm neck deep in my own startup endaevours though I am still contracting on the side. I'm most skilled in Javascript and Ruby though not limited to. I always love colaborating with people so feel free to reach out.</p>
